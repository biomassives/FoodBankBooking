Volunteer management software made for Ericsson's North Texas Foodbank Hackathon.

Description: Allows users to apply for a day to volunteer, then lets them brag about it on facebook. On the backend, we use WebRTC to call volunteers automatically with a reminder. 

We won 2nd place with this project.
